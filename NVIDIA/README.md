# NVIDIA (for Windows)
- Use [NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/) to install/update the NVIDIA driver.
- Use [NVIDIA App(Beta)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/) for screen recording. It does not reqiure NVIDIA account and also works without internet connection. (At least for current beta v10.0.0.499.)
